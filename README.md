## What is Hacker_AI?

Step into the frontier of cybersecurity with **Hacker_AI**, an AI-powered toolkit born from the mind of Bhanu Guragain, a BSc Ethical Hacking & Cybersecurity student at Coventry University. This isn’t just a project—it’s a mission to outpace threats with intelligence and innovation. Designed for ethical hackers, security researchers, and defenders, Hacker_AI fuses advanced AI models, self-healing systems, and modular toolsets to tackle vulnerabilities, hunt zero-days, and secure the future. Ready for quantum threats? Hacker_AI’s got you covered.

> **Why Me?** As a Coventry student, I’m blending academic rigor with real-world hacking flair to build tools that matter.
